# Hugging Face on Amazon SageMaker Workshop
![](./imgs/cover.png)

Earlier this year we announced a strategic collaboration with Amazon to make it easier for companies to use Hugging Face in SageMaker, and ship cutting-edge Machine Learning features faster. We introduced new Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) to train Hugging Face Transformer models in Amazon SageMaker.

In addition to the Hugging Face Inference Deep Learning Containers, we created a new Inference Toolkit for SageMaker. This new Inference Toolkit leverages the pipelines from the transformers library to allow zero-code deployments of models, without requiring any code for pre- or post-processing. In the "Getting Started" section below, you will find two examples of how to deploy your models to Amazon SageMaker.

The Inference Toolkit also supports "bring your own code" methods, where you can override the default methods. You can learn more about "bring your own code" in the documentation here, or you can check out the sample notebook "deploy custom inference code to Amazon SageMaker".

This workshop series covers the following topics

**Workshop 1:** Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker: Training your first NLP Transformer model with Hugging Face and deploy it
  * Learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to train a Hugging Face Transformer model and deploy it afterwards
      * Prepare and upload a test dataset to S3
      * Prepare a fine-tuning script to be used with Amazon SageMaker Training jobs
      * Launch a training job and store the trained model into S3
      * Deploy the model after successful training
